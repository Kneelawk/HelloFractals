The program:
z * z + c
would likely have the ast:
Program(
	Block(
		Sum(
			Mult(
				Variable("z"),
				Variable("z")
			),
			Variable("c")
		)
	)
)
This would likely involve looking up the variables "z" and "c" in the variable table which would include the predefined variables "z" and "c".

The program:
z ^ 2 + c
would likely have the ast:
Program(
	Block(
		Sum(
			Power(
				Variable("z"),
				Constant(2 + 0i)
			),
			Variable("c")
		)
	)
)

The program:
var m = z ^ 2
m + z * 2 + c
would likely have the ast:
Program(
	Block(
		Declare(
			"m",
			Power(
				Variable("z"),
				Constant(2 + 0i)
			)
		),
		Sum(
			Sum(
				Variable("m"),
				Mult(
					Variable("z"),
					Constant(2 + 0i)
				)
			),
			Variable("c")
		)
	)
)
All programs have a block as their base structure. All statements must return a value. A block's value is the value of its last statement.
How would I do verification?
There needs to be a difference between declaring a variable and assigning a variable.
